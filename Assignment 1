1) EQUAL TO OPERTOR:
a = 2
b = 4
print(a == b)
output:FALSE

2) NOT EQUAL TO OPERATOR:
a = 2
b = 4
print(a != b)
output:TRUE

3) GREATER THAN OPERATOR:
a = 2
b = 4
print(a > b)
output:FALSE

4) LESS THAN OPERATOR:
a = 2
b = 4
print(a < b)
output:TRUE

5) GREATER THAN EQUAL TO OPERATOR:
a = 10
b = 10
print(a >= b)
output:TRUE

6) LESSER THAN EQUAL TO OPERATOR:
a = 20
b = 20
print(a <= b)
output:TRUE
